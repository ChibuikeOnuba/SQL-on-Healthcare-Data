Healthcare Data Analysis with PostgreSQL
Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis project! This repository showcases PostgreSQL queries designed to analyze complex healthcare datasets generated by Synthea, a synthetic patient generation tool. This project aims to demonstrate skills in querying and extracting insights from healthcare data, focusing on various patient encounter types such as inpatient, outpatient, ambulatory, and emergency.

Project Overview
Healthcare data analysis is critical for improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare operations. However, real-world healthcare data often comes with privacy concerns and limited availability. Synthea provides a valuable solution by generating realistic synthetic patient data that mimics real-world scenarios without compromising privacy.

Key Features
Data Source: Synthetic patient data generated by Synthea
Focus Areas:
Patient encounters across different admission types
ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes
Healthcare terminologies such as SNOMED CT and LOINC
Tools: PostgreSQL for querying and data analysis
Repository Structure
queries/: Contains PostgreSQL query files for various analysis tasks
data/: Sample data files generated by Synthea (if applicable)
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis (optional)
Getting Started
